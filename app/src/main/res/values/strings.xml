    <string name="eazemeup_pp"><![CDATA[
 This privacy policy (Policy) describes how the personally identifiable information (Personal Information) you may provide in the \'Eazemeup\' mobile application (\'Mobile Application\' or \'Service\') and any of its related products and services (collectively, \'Services\') is collected, protected and used. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (\'User\', \'you\' or \'your\') and this Mobile Application developer (\'Operator\', \'we\', \'us\' or \'our\'). By accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
<br><br><font color=\'#832593\'>Automatic collection of information</font><br>
When you use the Mobile Application, our servers automatically record information that your device sends. This data may include information such as your device\'s IP address and location, device name and version, operating system type and version, language preferences, information you search for in the Mobile Application, access times and dates, and other statistics.
<br>Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding the usage of the Mobile Application and Services. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.
<br><br><font color=\'#832593\'>Collection of personal information</font><br>
You can access and use the Mobile Application and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the features in the Mobile Application, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, publish content,  or fill any online forms in the Mobile Application. When required, this information may include the following:
<br>
- Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.<br>
- Contact information such as email address, address, etc.<br>
- Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.<br>

- Any other materials you willingly submit to us such as articles, images, feedback, etc.<br>
<br>
Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Mobile Application and Services. However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as public databases and our joint marketing partners. You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features in the Mobile Application. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.
<br><br><font color=\'#832593\'>Use and processing of collected information</font><br>
In order to make the Mobile Application and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:
<br>
- Create and manage user accounts<br>
- Send administrative information<br>
- Respond to inquiries and offer support<br>

- Administer prize draws and competitions<br>
- Enforce terms and conditions and policies<br>
- Protect from abuse and malicious users<br>
- Respond to legal requests and prevent harm<br>
- Run and operate the Mobile Application and Services<br>
<br>
Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Mobile Application and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
<br>
Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
<br><br><font color=\'#832593\'>Managing information</font><br>
You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Mobile Application and Services change.

These third parties are given Personal Information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.
<br><br><font color=\'#832593\'>Retention of information</font><br>
We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.
<br><br><font color=\'#832593\'>Transfer of information</font><br>
Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information.

<br><br><font color=\'#832593\'>Information security</font><br>
We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

<br><br><font color=\'#832593\'>Data breach</font><br>
In the event we become aware that the security of the Mobile Application and Services has been compromised or users Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities.
